# Hotel_Console

The Carlington Hotel wants  a program in which the user enters the type of room that a guest wants (1 for single, 2 for double, 3 for suite), the floor desired (1 through 12), and the number of nights the guest will stay (any number is valid). Compute the nightly rate from the following table, multiply by the number of nights, and then provide a 10% discount on the total if the guest stays 4 or more nights.

                Single      Double      Suite

 Floor 1-5      45.00       60.00       130.00
 Floor 6-11     55.00       72.00       215.00
 Floor 12   Not Available  120.00       350.00

 Display the input data, the nightly price, and the total price for the guests stay, or display an error message if a combination is not available or if an invaild room type code or floor is entered.
